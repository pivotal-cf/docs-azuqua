## <a id='broker'></a>Azuqua Platform Connector Service Broker and Tile

The Azuqua Platform Connector service broker is a Java app that deploys to PCF and connects applications to the Azuqua Platform Connector service, via one or more Azuqua accounts. The broker component lets developers easily bind their apps to the service using either Pivotal Apps Manager or the command line. The service broker also publishes Azuqua Platform Connector service plans to the Pivotal Marketplace.

In the PCF Installation Dashboard, the Azuqua Platform Connector tile installs the Azuqua Platform Connector broker and registers it with Cloud Foundry. The tile enables installation, configuration, and subsequent use of Azuqua Platform Connector with your PCF apps.

Customers interested in using Azuqua Platform Connector can obtain a free Developer license [here](https://azuqua.com/integrate/pivotal-cloud-foundry/).
