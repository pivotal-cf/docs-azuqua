##<a id='troubleshoot'></a> Troubleshoot Azuqua Platform Connector for PCF

If you receive errors using the Azuqua Platform Connector tile or the Azuqua Designer, ensure the following:

* Users have the proper permissions from UAA to access the service broker.

* You have a CA signed certificate if your UAA is using HTTPS.

* You have entered the correct Azuqua access key and access token.

* You have network access to `api.azuqua.com` from the service broker and all subdomains of `azuqua.com` from your workstation.

After making any changes to accommodate the above requirements, you need to restage the Azuqua Platform Connector service on PCF and update the service catalog, as described [below](#restage).

##<a id='restage'></a> Restage Azuqua Platform Connector

To restage the Azuqua Platform Connector service and update the service catalog on PCF, do the following:

1. Run `cf restage azuqua`.

1. Run `cf update-service-broker azuqua USER PASSWORD SERVICE-BROKER-URL`.
  - To find `USER` and `PASSWORD`, run `cf env azuqua` and check the output for variables `SECURITY_USER_NAME` and `SECURITY_USER_PASSWORD`.
  - To find `SERVICE-BROKER-URL`, run `cf apps`.

As an alternative to the steps above, you can reinstall the Azuqua Platform Connector for PCF tile from the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
